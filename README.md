# Google DataTable Sync for Unreal Engine

### Overview

**Google DataTable Sync** is a plugin for `Unreal Engine 5` that seamlessly integrates the editor's `DataTables` with Google Sheets. It empowers game designers, level designers, and developers to manage complex game data collaboratively in the cloud and synchronize it back to the editor with a single click, drastically improving the data management workflow.

Unlike simple CSV exporters, **Google DataTable Sync** intelligently analyzes the structure of your `DataTable`. It can parse and represent deeply nested `UStructs`, `TArrays`, and even `TMaps`, generating an intuitive, color-coded, and hierarchical header in the spreadsheet. This preserves your data's complex relationships and makes it human-readable.
