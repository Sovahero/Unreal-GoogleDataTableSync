## Key Features:

Unlike simple CSV exporters, **Google DataTable Sync** intelligently analyzes the structure of your `DataTable`. It can parse and represent deeply nested `UStructs`, `TArrays`, and even `TMaps`, generating an intuitive, color-coded, and hierarchical header in the spreadsheet. This preserves your data's complex relationships and makes it human-readable.

*   **Seamless Two-Way Synchronization:** Export from Unreal, edit in the cloud, and import changes back.
*   **Built for Large Tables:** A high-performance architecture using batched API requests ensures fast and syncing for tables with thousands of rows.
*   **Complex Data Structures:** Full support for nested `UStructs`, `TArrays`, and `TMaps`.
*   **Intelligent Headers:** Generates color-coded, and hierarchical headers in Google Sheets for easy navigation of complex data.
*   **Deep Editor Integration:** Adds Import/Export buttons directly to the DataTable Editor toolbar for a streamlined, native-feeling workflow.
*   **No External Dependencies:** Requires no third-party libraries or complex setup, working out-of-the-box with built-in engine modules.
